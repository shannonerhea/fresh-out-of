A Smart Shopping List that learns your buying habits over time

## Overview

Me and a team of 3 other Developers built out this application over an 8 week period of time. We worked in an Agile enviroment utlizing sprints, pair programming, code reviews, code presentations, pull requests and documentation.

## What is this project?

The goal of this project is to collaborate with your Collab Lab team to create a “smart” shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you’re likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

### How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.
